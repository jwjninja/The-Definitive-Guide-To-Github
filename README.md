# The-Definitive-Guide-To-Github
This is the repo used in an article published to Pluralsight.

I am making this repository to allow others to view it after reading the article. It also allows me to do screenshots and perform actions along side writing the article. This is good practice to make sure I don't miss anything.

You can find the article at [This link](http://insertarticlelinkehere)
